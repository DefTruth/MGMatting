## Image Matting
Please refer to [IMAGE.md](IMAGE.md) for details.

## Fully Automatic Matting System
We further train MG Matting with an internal portrait matting dataset consisting of 4395 samples, and combine it with a base segmentation model to obtain a fully automatic matting system. We compare this system to latest trimap-free matting system (MODNet)[https://github.com/ZHKKKe/MODNet] and also commercial software Photoshop 2021.

Please refer to [SYSTEM.md](SYSTEM.md) for details.

## Video Matting
We note that MG Matting, though not utilizing temporal information yet, can potentially produce great results on videos. Please refer to the following links for video demos.
